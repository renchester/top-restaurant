        <p class="about-info history">
          The "CURRY HOUSE CoCo ICHIBANYA" started from 3 shops surrounded by
          rice fields in the suburb area of Nagoya, in 1978. With our customer
          first spirit, we have been supported by many customers for 40 years
          until now, and in 2004, we were able to increase our shops up to
          1,000. Today, CoCoICHI has expanded overseas to such as Hawaii,
          Shanghai, Bangkok, Hong Kong, and Los Angeles, and is continuing to be
          loved by the local customers.
